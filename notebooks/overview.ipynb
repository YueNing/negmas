    "\n",
    "The package is organized into a set of modules the combine together related functionality. In general there are *base* modules that implement the most general abstractions and concepts and then *specialized* modules that implement the computational structures needed for a specific application or research domain:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Base Modules** These are the most general modules and all other *specialized* modules use the computational resources defined here. The base modules provided in this version are:\n",
    "    1. **outcomes** This module represents issues, outcome and responses and provides basic functions and methods to operator with and on them.\n",
    "    1. **utilities** This modules represents the base type of all utilities and different widely used utility function types including linear and nonlinear utilities and constraint-based utilities.\n",
    "    1. **negotiators** This module represents basic negotiation agent implementation and provide basic interfaces to be overriden (implemented) by higher specialized modules\n",
    "    1. **mechanisms** This module represents the most basic conceptual view of a negotiation protocol supporting both mediate and unmediated mechanisms. The term `mechanism` was used  instead of the more common `protocol` to stress the fact that this mechanism need not be a standard negotiation protocol. For example auction mechanisms (like second-price auctions) can easily be implemented in this package.\n",
    "    1. **opponent_models** This module provides the basic interface for all opponent models.\n",
    "    1. **situated** This module implements world simulations within which agents with intrinsic utilty functions can engage in simulataneous connected situated negotiations. It is the most important module for the goals of this library.\n",
    "    1. **Helper Modules** These modules provide basic activities that is not directly related to the negotiation but that are relied upon by different base modules. The end user is not expected to interact directly with these modules.\n",
    "        * **common** Provides common interfaces that are used by all other modules. \n",
    "        * **generics** Provides a set of types and interfaces to increase the representation flexibility of different base modules. \n",
    "        * **helpers** Various helper functions and classes used throughout the library including mixins for logging.\n",
    "        \n",
    "* **App Modules** This namespace provides the modules needed to run different *apps* that represent worlds within which negotiations take place.\n",
    "    1. **scml** The Supply Chain Management App as defined for the SCM leage of ANAC 2019 competition.\n",
    "    \n",
    "To simplify the use of this library, all classes and functions from all base modules are aliased in the root package (except generics and helpers). This is an example of importing just `Outcome`"

The protocol is free to handle this situation. It may just end the negotiation with no agreement, may just remove the agent from the negotiation and keep it running with the remaining agents (if that makes sense) or just gives the agent a second chance by treating it as just a ``REJECT_OFFER`` case. In most case the first response (just end the negotiation) is expected.\n",
